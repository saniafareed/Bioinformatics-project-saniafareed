5′ Cap (m⁷Gppp): Modified guanine that initiates translation and marks mRNA as “self.”
5′ UTR: Non-coding region that helps regulate translation efficiency.
Coding Sequence (ORF): Protein-coding region from AUG start to stop codon.
3′ UTR: Controls mRNA stability, localization, and translation rate.
Poly(A) Tail: Adenine chain that increases stability and translation efficiency.
Overall Role: Ensures proper mRNA protection, transport, and protein synthesis.
