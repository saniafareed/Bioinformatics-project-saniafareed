## Project Overview
This project involves a complete computational analysis of an unknown DNA sequence using multiple bioinformatics tools. The analysis follows a systematic pipeline starting from DNA sequence analysis to RNA feature prediction, protein characterization, subcellular localization, phylogenetic analysis, and protein–protein interaction study. All results are organized step-wise according to the provided project guidelines.

## Tools Used
- NCBI BLASTn / BLASTp
- ORF Finder
- ExPASy Translate & ProtParam
- RNAfold (ViennaRNA)
- InterPro / Pfam
- PSORT / CELLO / DeepLoc
- STRING database
- MEGA / Clustal Omega


## Summary
The analysis identified a coding gene from the provided DNA sequence, which was translated into a functional protein. RNA structure prediction revealed stable secondary structures. Protein domain analysis suggested functional relevance, while localization tools predicted the protein to be localized mainly in the cytoplasmic region. Phylogenetic analysis showed evolutionary conservation among related species, and interaction analysis revealed biologically significant protein partners.
