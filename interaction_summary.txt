This STRING network reveals a tightly coordinated interactome of PKS and NRPS mega-enzymes in Bacillus subtilis, forming an organelle-like biosynthetic complex.
These interactions enable precise assembly-line synthesis of complex secondary metabolites.
Physical clustering improves metabolic efficiency by retaining unstable intermediates.
The network underpins antibiotic production crucial for bacterial competitiveness.
Mapping it is key for bioengineering and reprogramming these systems for drug discovery.
